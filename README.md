# Weather App
This is a simple weather app built with Node.js, Express.js, HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. The app allows users to check the current temperature of their city by entering the city name or the zip code. It retrieves the weather data from an external API, and displays the current temperature, along with other weather information such as humidity, wind speed, and weather description. The app is responsive and designed to work well on both desktop and mobile devices.
